##### Average vs Mean (Difference Between Average and Mean)

To understand the **difference between Average and Mean** one must be aware of what separates one from the other. Average and mean are used interchangeably. In Statistics, instead of the term “average”, the term “mean” is used. Average can simply be defined as a quantity or a rate which usually fall under the center of the data. Average is quite similar to mean but also has its key differences from mean as well. If one can understand the [arithmetic mean and range](https://byjus.com/maths/arithmetic-mean-and-range/), it can be incredibly helpful in understanding and solving math topics.

## Average Definition

The term “Average” describes a value that should represent the sample. An average is defined as the sum of all the values divided by the total number of values in a given set. It is also known as the arithmetic mean. Let us consider a simple data to find the average.

Given set of values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Average = Sum of all the values/ total number of values

Average = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3

## Mean Definition

A mean is a mathematical term, that also describes the average of a sample. In Statistics, the definition of the mean is similar to the average. But, it can also be defined as the sum of the smallest value and the largest value in the given data set divided by 2.

Mean = (Sum of the smallest value and the largest value)/ 2

Let consider the same example given above:

The smallest value is 1, and the largest value is 5

Therefore, mean = (1+5)/2 = 6/ 2 = 3

You can observe that, the result of both the average and mean for the given data set is similar.



**Difference between Average and Mean**

Average and mean are usually confused with one another as they are both mathematical terms used to explain a set of numbers. Mean can simply be calculated by adding and dividing the sum of the number of quantities. Thus, this is the core definition of what mean is. You can find the whole tabular column of differences below:

|                         **Average**                          |                           **Mean**                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Average can simply be defined as the sum of all the numbers divided by the total number of values. | Mean on the other hand is the result of the addition of the largest and smallest numbers in the set and dividing them by 2 |
|    Average is usually present as mean or arithmetic mean.    | Mean is simply a method of describing the average of the sample. |
| Average can be calculated for any discrete numbers where it assumes uniform distribution. | It is mainly used in Statistics and it is applied for any distribution such as geometric, binomial, Poisson distribution, and so on. |
|   The arithmetic mean is considered as a form of average.    |               There are various types of mean.               |
| Average is usually used in conversations in general day to day English. |   Mean is used in a more technical and mathematical sense.   |
| The average is capable of giving us the median and the mode. | Mean, on the other hand, cannot give us the median or mode.  |

### **Regression**

1. #### **Linear Regression**

   The goal of regression is to develop an equation or formula that best describes the relationship between variables.

   How do we find a best-fit line?
   ● Consider a dataset with only one variable
   ● The best-fit line is just the mean value of the data points

   ##### **The general goal of  regression is to find a line that best describes our data by minimizing that sum of squares error.**

   Our goal is to predict the value of a dependent variable (y) based on that of an independent variable (x).
