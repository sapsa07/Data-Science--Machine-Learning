#### **1. What is Data Science ?**

Data Science is the process of finding hidden patterns from raw/unstructured data. 

**Unstructured data are not inter related ** 



**Commonly Used Data Science Algorithms**

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Naive Bayes
5. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
6. K-Means Clustering
7. Random Forest

**Data Science Process**

1. Understanding the problem
2. Data Gathering
3. Data Processing
4. Data Analysis
5. Data Visualization
6. Data Cleaning
7. Creating and testing model

**Steps  to understand the problem:**

- Ask the why questions about the problem.
- Understand the end product required solution
- Determine the data sources for this problem
- At the end of this step, have all information and context which you require to solve this problem.

**Data Gathering**

Data Extraction is the process of retrieving data from various sources to be used in the data science process.
